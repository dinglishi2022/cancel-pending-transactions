# Cancel Pending Transaction Program

This is a program designed to cancel pending transactions. It currently offers support for the Holesky network.

**Functionality**:
- It can effectively identify and target pending transactions.
- Through specific algorithms and procedures, it attempts to cancel those identified pending transactions.

**Technical Details**:
- The program utilizes [list the specific technologies or programming languages used] to interact with the Holesky network.
- It follows the network protocols and standards of Holesky to ensure proper operation and communication.

**How to Use**:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Configure the necessary settings, such as connection details to the Holesky network.
3. Run the program and it will start scanning for pending transactions and attempt to cancel them.

**Limitations**:
- There may be certain types of pending transactions that the program is unable to handle due to network complexity or other factors.
- Performance may vary depending on the load and conditions of the Holesky network.

**Future Improvements**:
- Plans to expand support to other networks in the future.
- Optimization of the cancellation process to increase efficiency.
